// Mocking calculations based on likely function signature. 
// I'll need to verify the actual function signature first, but creating the placeholder.
// Actually, let's read the calculations file first to be sure.
// Wait, I can't read it in this turn if I write this file now.
// I'll write a basic structure and fill it in the next turn after reading, OR I'll read it now.
// Better: Read calculations.js first.

// Cancel this tool call? No, I'll just write a generic test and update it.
// Or better yet, I should read calculations.js in this turn and write the test in the next.
// But the user wants speed.
// I'll read calculations.js IN THIS TURN using read_file in parallel? 
// No, I can't use the output of a parallel tool in the same turn.
// I will just read calculations.js now and install vitest.
